# Cocoa and Cassava Yield Analysis in Ondo State, Nigeria (1991-2020)
## Introduction
Agriculture is a crucial sector in Ondo State, Nigeria, with cocoa and cassava being two of the most significant crops in terms of both economic value and food security. This research aims to analyze the yield patterns of these crops over a 30-year period (1991-2020) and investigate the influence of key climate variables, specifically temperature and rainfall, on their productivity.

## Data Collection
The data for this analysis was sourced from two primary institutions:

### Ministry of Agriculture, Ondo State: Provided annual yield data for cocoa and cassava from 1991 to 2020.
### Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET): Supplied data on temperature and rainfall, which are critical climate variables impacting agricultural productivity.
## Cocoa and Cassava Yield Data
The yield data for cocoa and cassava spans three decades, offering a comprehensive overview of production trends. This dataset includes:

### Cocoa Yield: Annual production figures for cocoa, measured in tonnes per hectare.
### Cassava Yield: Annual production figures for cassava, also measured in tonnes per hectare.
## Climate Data
To understand the environmental factors influencing crop yields, the following climate data was collected:

### Temperature: Annual average temperature readings.
### Rainfall: Annual total rainfall measurements.
## Objectives
The primary objectives of this research are:

### Trend Analysis: Identify and analyze trends in the yield of cocoa and cassava over the 30-year period.
### Climate Impact Assessment: Determine the correlation between temperature, rainfall, and crop yields.
### Predictive Modeling: Develop models to predict future yields based on historical climate data.
## Methodology
### Descriptive Statistics: Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for yield and climate data to understand the central tendencies and variability.
### Trend Analysis: Use time series analysis to identify long-term trends and seasonal patterns in crop yields.
### Correlation Analysis: Assess the relationship between yield and climate variables using Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient.
### Regression Modeling: Develop linear regression models to predict crop yields based on temperature and rainfall data.
## Findings and Discussion
The analysis is expected to reveal significant insights, such as:

### Yield Trends: How the yields of cocoa and cassava have changed over the years, including any periods of significant increase or decrease.
Climate Influence: The degree to which temperature and rainfall variations correlate with changes in crop yields.
### Predictive Insights: Projections for future yields under different climate scenarios, which can inform agricultural planning and policy.
## Conclusion
Understanding the historical yield patterns of cocoa and cassava and their relationship with climate variables is crucial for developing strategies to enhance agricultural productivity in Ondo State. 
This research provides valuable insights that can guide farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders in making informed decisions to ensure sustainable agricultural development in the region.
